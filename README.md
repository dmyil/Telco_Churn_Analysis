# Telco_Churn_Analysis
Telco Customer Churn Analysis and Machine Learning Modeling


In this project, I have performed basic EDA, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis to understand which data points affect telco's customer churn the most and how we, as a company, can reduce the customer churn through Business Recommendations post the analysis which are below-

FINAL BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Tie customers to longer contracts by offering discounts, promotions and offers to reduce churn.
2. Re-check, investigate and imprive quality of all the technical services by taking out surveys and collecting customer feedback. (Improve especially the fiber optic and streaming services)
3. Provide small discounts for autopay (Ex 2 dollars off per month) and encourage customers to sign up for autopay credit card payment method
for steady cash inflow, avoiding customer penalty for missed payments and to reduce customer churn
